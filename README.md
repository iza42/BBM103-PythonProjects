# 🐍 BBM103 - Python Projects

> This repository contains all the Python projects I developed during the **1st year / 1st semester** as part of the **BBM103 - Introduction to Programming with Python** course at Hacettepe University, Computer Engineering Department.

Each project is stored in its own folder with clean structure and documentation, focusing on both functionality and good coding practices.

## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔍 `data-science-answering-some-questions`
A mini data science project where I analyzed and answered questions from a real dataset using Python (pandas, matplotlib etc.). The goal was to extract meaningful insights and apply basic data science methods.

### 🎮 `game-goPy`
A simple console-based **game** developed in Python. The project highlights basic game loops, input handling, and terminal UI using OOP principles.

### 🔢 `sudokuSolving`
A **Sudoku solver** . Emphasis was given on recursion, board validation, and algorithmic problem-solving.

### 🔐 `enigmaMachine`
A simulation of the historical **Enigma encryption machine**. The project helped me understand string manipulation, encoding logic, and modular design.

### 🛡 `securityCounsel`
A mock **counsel system**.  Implemented decision structures and file handling for a rule-based advisor.

### 🌱 `conway'sGameOfLife`
A simulation of **Conway's Game of Life** built from scratch. Focused on grid-based algorithms, iteration over cells, and console-based visualizations.
